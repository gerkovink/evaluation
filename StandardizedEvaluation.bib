  abstract = {The use of the Gibbs sampler with fully conditionally specified models, where the distribution of each variable given the other variables is the starting point, has become a popular method to create imputations in incomplete multivariate data. The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.},

We motivate why the imputation of RWD may require additional efforts to avoid bias, and highlight recent advances that account for informative missingness and repeated observations.

  abstract = {Conducting sample surveys, imputing incomplete observations, and analyzing the resulting data are three indispensable phases of modern practice with public-use data files and with many other statistical applications. Each phase inherits different input, including the information preceding it and the intellectual assessments available, and aims to provide output that is one step closer to arriving at statistical inferences with scientific relevance. However, the role of the imputation phase has often been viewed as merely providing computational convenience for users of data. Although facilitating computation is very important, such a viewpoint ignores the imputer's assessments and information inaccessible to the users. This view underlies the recent controversy over the validity of multiple-imputation inference when a procedure for analyzing multiply imputed data sets cannot be derived from (is "uncongenial" to) the model adopted for multiple imputation. Given sensible imputations and complete-data analysis procedures, inferences from standard multiple-imputation combining rules are typically superior to, and thus different from, users' incomplete-data analyses. The latter may suffer from serious nonresponse biases because such analyses often must rely on convenient but unrealistic assumptions about the nonresponse mechanism. When it is desirable to conduct inferences under models for nonresponse other than the original imputation model, a possible alternative to recreating imputations is to incorporate appropriate importance weights into the standard combining rules. These points are reviewed and explored by simple examples and general theory, from both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives, particularly from the randomization perspective. Some convenient terms are suggested for facilitating communication among researchers from different perspectives when evaluating multiple-imputation inferences with uncongenial sources of input.},

Analysis:\hspace{0.6em} In this paper, we provide an overview of currently available methods for checking imputation models. These include graphical checks and numerical summaries, as well as simulation-based methods such as posterior predictive checking. These model checking techniques are illustrated using an analysis affected by missing data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) is a method for prioritization and profiling of chemicals that integrates data from diverse sources. However,  individual data sources ("assays"), such as in vitro bioassays or in vivo study  endpoints, often feature sections of missing data, wherein subsets of chemicals have  not been tested in all assays. In order to investigate the effects of missing data  and recommend solutions, we designed simulation studies around high-throughput  screening data generated by the ToxCast and Tox21 programs on chemicals highlighted  by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's (ATSDR) Substance Priority  List (SPL), which helps prioritize environmental research and remediation resources.  RESULTS: Our simulations explored a wide range of scenarios concerning data (0-80\%  assay data missing per chemical), modeling (ToxPi models containing from 160-700  different assays), and imputation method (k-Nearest-Neighbor, Max, Mean, Min,  Binomial, Local Least Squares, and Singular Value Decomposition). We find that most  imputation methods result in significant changes to ToxPi score, except for datasets  with a small number of assays. If we consider rank change conditional on these  significant changes to ToxPi score, we find that ranks of chemicals in the minimum  value imputation, SVD imputation, and kNN imputation sets are more sensitive to the  score changes. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the choice of imputation strategy exerted  significant influence over both scores and associated ranks, and the most sensitive  scenarios were those involving fewer assays plus higher proportions of missing data.  By characterizing the effects of missing data and the relative benefit of imputation  approaches across real-world data scenarios, we can augment confidence in the  robustness of decisions regarding the health and ecological effects of environmental  chemicals.},

  abstract = {Current pooling rules for multiply imputed data assume infinite populations. In some situations this assumption is not feasible as every unit in the population has been observed, potentially leading to over-covered population estimates. We simplify the existing pooling rules for situations where the sampling variance is not of interest. We compare these rules to the conventional pooling rules and demonstrate their use in a situation where there is no sampling variance. Using the standard pooling rules in situations where sampling variance should not be considered, leads to overestimation of the variance of the estimates of interest, especially when the amount of missingness is not very large. As a result, populations estimates are over-covered, which may lead to a loss of statistical power. We conclude that the theory of multiple imputation can be extended to the situation where the sample happens to be the population. The simplified pooling rules can be easily implemented to obtain valid inference in cases where we have observed essentially all units and in simulation studies addressing the missingness mechanism only.},

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to perform simulation studies to evaluate the properties of imputation methods. In this paper I propose a move towards a standardized evaluation of imputation methods. To demonstrate the need for standardization, I highlight a set of potential pitfalls that bring forth a chain of potential problems in the objective assessment of the performance of imputation routines. This may lead to suboptimal use of multiple imputation in practice. Additionally, I suggest a course of action for simulating and evaluating missing data problems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Incomplete data are of particular important influence in mental measurement questionnaires. Most experts, however, mostly focus on clinical trials  and cohort studies and generally pay less attention to this deficiency. We aim is to  compare the accuracy of four common methods for handling items missing from  different psychology questionnaires according to the items non-response rates.  METHOD: All data were drawn from the previous studies including the self-acceptance  scale (SAQ), the activities of daily living scale (ADL) and self-esteem scale  (RSES). SAQ and ADL dataset, simulation group, were used to compare and assess the  ability of four imputation methods which are direct deletion, mode imputation,  Hot-deck (HD) imputation and multiple imputation (MI) by absolute deviation, the  root mean square error and average relative error in missing proportions of 5, 10,  15 and 20\%. RSES dataset, validation group, was used to test the application of  imputation methods. All analyses were finished by SAS 9.4. RESULTS: The biases  obtained by MI are the smallest under various missing proportions. HD imputation  approach performed the lowest absolute deviation of standard deviation values. But  they got the similar results and the performances of them are obviously better than  direct deletion and mode imputation. In a real world situation, the respondents'  average score in complete data set was 28.22\,{$\pm$}\,4.63, which are not much different  from imputed datasets. The direction of the influence of the five factors on  self-esteem was consistent, although there were some differences in the size and  range of OR values in logistic regression model. CONCLUSION: MI shows the best  performance while it demands slightly more data analytic capacity and skills of  programming. And HD could be considered to impute missing values in psychological  investigation when MI cannot be performed due to limited circumstances.},

This research develops a new diagnostic method for checking MI models and proposes a test statistic with a standard p value. The new diagnostic checking method is effective and flexible. It does not depend on the proportion of missing values and can deal with data sets with arbitrary nonmonotone missing data patterns. We examine the performance of the proposed method in a simulation study and illustrate the method in a study of coronary disease and associated factors.},
