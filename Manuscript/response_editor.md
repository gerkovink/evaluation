# Response to reviewer 1 and to the editor

We value the comments and suggestions that you both provide with respect to the suggestion of using finite sample pooling rules as a simulation strategy for excluding sampling variance. We agree that our wording may have been too narrow and strict and have rewritten section 2.1. The revised manuscript reflects on the applicability of these pooling rules to a single real-life scenario and details how replicating this scenario may be convenient for simulation studies. We also highlight that adopting such a simulation strategy is by no means necessary, as sampling variance is easily accounted for by Rubin's rules. We are confident that the revised manuscript provides the readership with a fair scope of simulation strategies and have created and added a reference that details in code the usage of all discussed simulation designs.  

We are confident that the revised manuscript would be useful for the readership of Biometrical Journal.
