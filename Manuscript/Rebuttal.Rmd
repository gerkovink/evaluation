# Revisions

- Narrowing the scope of the manuscript to the evaluation of methodology for statistical inference, not prediction or causal inference (although inferential validity encompasses predictive validity and may thus be generalized?).
- Emphasizing that the ideal evaluation of imputation methodology depends on the aim of the specific study (i.e. how the evaluated methods are used in practice).
- Substituted the table with specific suggested missingness proportions for more general advice to evaluate several missingness proportions.
