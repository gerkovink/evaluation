Unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to perform simulation studies to evaluate the properties of imputation methods. In this paper I propose a move towards a standardized evaluation of imputation methods. To demonstrate the need for standardization, I highlight a set of potential pitfalls that bring forth a chain of potential problems in the objective assessment of the performance of imputation routines. This may lead to suboptimal use of multiple imputation in practice. Additionally, I suggest a course of action for simulating and evaluating missing data problems.},

  abstract = {Model checking in multiple imputation (MI, Rubin in Multiple imputation for nonresponse in surveys, Wiley, New York, 1987) becomes increasingly important with the recent developments in MI and its widespread use in statistical analysis with missing data (e.g. van Buuren et al. in J Stat Comput Simul 76(12):1049\textendash 1064, 2006; van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn in J Stat Soft 45(3):1\textendash 67, 2011; Chen et al. in Biometrics 67:799\textendash 809, 2011; Nguyen et al. in Emerg Themes Epidemiol 14(8):1\textendash 12, 2017). The currently recommended posterior predictive checking method (He and Zaslavsky in Stat Med 31:1\textendash 18, 2012; Nguyen et al. in Biom J 4:676\textendash 694, 2015) is less effective when the proportion of missing values increases and its produced posterior predictive p value is not supported by a null distribution as a standard p value (Meng in Annu Stat 22:1142\textendash 1160, 1994). This research develops a new diagnostic method for checking MI models and proposes a test statistic with a standard p value. The new diagnostic checking method is effective and flexible. It does not depend on the proportion of missing values and can deal with data sets with arbitrary nonmonotone missing data patterns. We examine the performance of the proposed method in a simulation study and illustrate the method in a study of coronary disease and associated factors.},
