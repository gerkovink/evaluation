title: "Towards a standardized evaluation of multiple imputation routines"

abstract: "Developing new imputation methodology has become a very active field. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to perform simulation studies to evaluate the properties of imputation methods. In this paper I propose a move towards a standardized evaluation of imputation methods. To demonstrate the need for standardization, I highlight a set of potential pitfalls that bring forth a chain of potential problems in the objective assessment of the performance of imputation routines. This may lead to suboptimal use of multiple imputation in practice. Additionally, I suggest a course of action for simulating and evaluating missing data problems."
